# Surface-Pro-7-Hackintosh-EFI

This is my own copy of **OpenCore EFI folder** for **Microsoft Surface Pro 7**

**My specs:**

 - Intel Core i7 10th Gen
 - 16GB Ram
 - 512GB SSD
 - Typecover

**What's working:**

**Notes**

 1. Type cover **works**
 2. Battery drain **very fast**
 3. Bootcamp **doesn't work** somehow
 4. Due to the performance (yes, it does usable) but its not that fast for an i7 CPU, and the reliability, **I don't recommend Hackintosh as daily drivers**


And importantly, this EFI folder is **for my specific model**, and **macOS Monterey** version, if you have the same model, feel free to try it, but I am **not making this EFI**, nor **knowing how to fixing bugs**, this EFI folder is just a **combination of many sources and EFI online**, so **don't ask or blame me if anything is wrong with your devices.**

Oh and after publishing this, I will erase it and install Windows back again, yay :)
